## ✉️ EMAIL TEMPLATE (Send to Firms)

**Subject: Save 3 Hours Per Bridge Drawing**

```
Hi [Name],

I built a tool that generates professional bridge drawings in 90 seconds instead of 10 minutes.

Your team could save:
- 3 hours per drawing
- 150 hours per month
- $9,000 value per month

Try it free: [Your Streamlit URL]

Takes 2 minutes to test.

If it works for you, we have plans starting at $20/month that pay for themselves in hours.

Let me know what you think!

Best,
RKS LEGAL Team
