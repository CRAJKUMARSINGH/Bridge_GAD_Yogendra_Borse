## ✨ What Makes This Brilliant?

**Bridge GAD Generator** is a lightning-fast Python tool that automates bridge design drafting. Upload an Excel file with bridge parameters, click generate, and download professional AutoCAD-compatible DXF drawings in under 2 seconds. No manual CAD work, no expensive software licenses, no weeks of drafting time.

Built for civil engineers, contractors, and consultants who need to produce IRC/IS-compliant bridge drawings quickly and accurately. Save 40+ hours per project and eliminate human drafting errors.

**One Excel file in. Professional CAD drawings out. That simple.**
