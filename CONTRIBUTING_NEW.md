## 📋 Code Guidelines

### Style
- **Keep it simple** – Follow the lean philosophy (no bloat!)
- **Use clear names** – `calculate_pier_width()` not `cpw()`
- **Add comments** – Explain *why*, not *what*
- **Format code** – Use Black or similar formatter
- **Type hints** – Add them for function parameters

### Example
```python
def calculate_span_length(
    total_length: float,
    num_spans: int,
    pier_width: float = 1.2
) -> float:
    """
    Calculate individual span length for multi-span bridge.
    
    Args:
        total_length: Total bridge length in meters
        num_spans: Number of spans
        pier_width: Width of each pier in meters (default: 1.2m)
    
    Returns:
        Individual span length in meters
    """
    effective_length = total_length - (num_spans - 1) * pier_width
    return effective_length / num_spans
```

### Testing
```bash
# Test your changes manually
streamlit run app_lean.py

# If you added tests (optional but appreciated):
pytest tests/

# Check code style (optional):
black app_lean.py
flake8 app_lean.py
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Guidelines

### Keep It Lean
This project follows the **lean philosophy**:
- ✅ Minimal dependencies (currently 6)
- ✅ Simple architecture (3 core files)
- ✅ Direct code (no over-abstraction)
- ✅ Fast startup (< 2 seconds)

### Before Adding Dependencies
Ask yourself:
1. Is this absolutely necessary?
2. Can we implement it ourselves in < 50 lines?
3. Is the dependency well-maintained?
4. Does it add significant value?

**If in doubt, discuss in an issue first!**
